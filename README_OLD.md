3. Humans rally in groups randomly. Zombies, instead pick up individual survivals, they pick up surviving groups.


## Variables
### Independing Variables
Initial Constant 
- Number of Citizens
- Number of Zombies
- Number of Ammo
- Choice of Strategy
- How deadly a zombie attack could be: aggregate of r
    - 0.8 < R <1: the poor person is eaten, very likely when surrounded by more than 1 zombie
    - 0.5 < R <0.8: the poor person is turned a zombie
    - 0.1 < R <0.5: the lucky person escaped
    - 0< R <0.1: the brave person kill the zombies.
### Random Variables
For Zombie:
- Randomly picked zombies from all citizens. Represented by UIN
- Randomly picked a survivor to attact by one zombie.

- f multiple zombies chose the same target, 1 - r1*r2*râ€¦.*rn
- In strategy 4, Randomly pick a survivor groups to attack
For Human:
- Randomly assigned for ammo.
- Randomly picked a zombie to shot for each bullet.
